## 242. Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


### Example 1

- Input:

```
s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
```


- Output:

```shell
true
```

### Example 2

- Input:

```
s = "rat", t = "car"
```

- Output:

```shell
false
```


### Constraints
- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

Notes:

- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 
### Follow up:
- What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
