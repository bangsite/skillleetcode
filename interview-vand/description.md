## Vand: Divide the characters below into multiple groups
Divide the characters below into multiple groups:
[“A”, “B”, “C”, “D”, “E”, “F”, “G”, “H”]

Please answer in TypeScript.

All items must be allocated into groups.
Items in each group must be chosen randomly.
Each item must belong to only one group.
Min group size is 2 and max group size is 3.

Count of 3-size groups >= count of 2-size groups.
The number of dividable characters can be 8 or more.

### Example 1

- Input:

```
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H']
```

- Output:

```shell
 [ [ 'H', 'E', 'B' ], [ 'D', 'G', 'A' ], [ 'C', 'F' ] ]
```

### Example 2

- Input:

```
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'I', 'J', 'K']
```

- Output:

```shell
[ [ 'G', 'H', 'A' ], [ 'E', 'B', 'I' ], [ 'C', 'F', 'D'
],[ 'J', 'K' ] ]

```
- Explanation:

Notes:

- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 6^5 = six to the power of five
