## 66. Sqrt(x)

Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer
should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

### Example 1

- Input:

```
x = 4
```

- Output:

```shell
2
```

- Explanation:Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

### Example 2

- Input:

```
 x = 8
```

- Output:

```shell
2
```

- Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

### Constraints

- 0 <= x <= 231 - 1

Notes:

- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 6^5 = six to the power of five
