## 7. Reverse Integer

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).
### Example 1

- Input:

```
x = 123
```

- Output:

```shell
321
```

- Explanation:

### Example 2

- Input:

```
 x = -123
```

- Output:

```shell
-321
```
### Example 3

- Input:

```
 x = 120
```

- Output:

```shell
21
```
- Explanation: 

### Constraints

- -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1

Notes:

- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 6^5 = six to the power of five
