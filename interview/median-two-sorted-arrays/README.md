## 169. Majority Element

Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.


### Example 1

- Input:

```
nums = [3,2,3]
```

- Output:

```shell
3

```

### Example 2

- Input:

```
nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]

```

- Output:

```shell
2
```

- Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).

### Constraints
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 5 * 104
- 109 <= nums[i] <= 109

Notes:
- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
