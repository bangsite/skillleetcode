## 75. Sort Colors

Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


### Example 1

- Input:

```
nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
```

- Output:

```shell
[0,0,1,1,2,2]

```
- Explanation:

### Example 2

- Input:

```
height = [2,0,1]
```

- Output:

```shell
[0,1,2]
```
- Explanation:

### Constraints
- n == nums.length
- 1 <= n <= 300
- nums[i] is either 0, 1, or 2.

### Follow up: 
Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant extra space?

### Notes:
- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 2^6 = two the power of  six
