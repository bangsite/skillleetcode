## 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.




### Example 1

- Input:

```
 list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
```

- Output:

```shell
[1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

- Explanation:

### Example 2

- Input:

```
list1 = [], list2 = []

```

- Output:

```shell
[]

```
### Example 3

- Input:

```
list1 = [], list2 = [0]

```

- Output:

```shell
[0]

```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
- 100 <= Node.val <= 100
Both list1 and list2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.

  
Notes:

- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 6^5 = six to the power of five
