## 35. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.



### Example 1

- Input:

```
nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
```

- Output:

```shell
2
```

### Example 2

- Input:

```
nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2

```

- Output:

```shell
1
```

### Example 3

- Input:

```
nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
```

- Output:

```shell
4
```
- Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

### Constraints
- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104
- nums contains distinct values sorted in ascending order.
- -104 <= target <= 104


Notes:

- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
