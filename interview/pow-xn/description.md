## 50. Pow(x, n)

Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn)..

### Example 1

- Input:

```
 x = 2.00000, n = 10
```

- Output:

```shell
1024.00000

```

- Explanation:

### Example 2

- Input:

```
x = 2.10000, n = 3
```

- Output:

```shell
9.26100
```

- Explanation:

### Example 3

- Input:

```
x = 2.00000, n = -2
```

- Output:

```shell
0.25000
```

- Explanation: 2^-2 = 1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25

### Constraints

- -100.0 < x < 100.0
- 2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
- n is an integer.
- Either x is not zero or n > 0. 
- -10^4 <= x^n <= 10^4

Notes:

- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 2^6 = two the power of six
