## 136. Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.


### Example 1

- Input:

```
nums =[2,2,1]
```

- Output:

```shell
1

```
- Explanation: 

### Example 2

- Input:

```
nums=[4,1,2,1,2]
```

- Output:

```shell
4
```
- Explanation:
- ### Example 3

- Input:

```
nums=[1]
```

- Output:

```shell
1
```
- Explanation:

### Constraints
- 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4

Notes:
- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 2^6 = two the power of  six
