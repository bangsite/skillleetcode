## 9. Palindrome Number
Given an integer x, return true if x is a
palindrome, and false otherwise.



### Example 1

- Input:

```
x = 121
```

- Output:

```shell
true
```

- Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

### Example 2

- Input:

```
x = -121
```

- Output:

```shell
false
```
- Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
### Example 3

- Input:

```
x = 10
```

- Output:

```shell
 false

```
- Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
### Constraints
- -231 <= x <= 231 - 1

Follow up: Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?


Notes:

- If >= (Is greater than or equal to) else (<= : is less than or equal to ...);
- 10^2 = ten squared
- 10^3 = ten cubed
- 6^5 = six to the power of five
